I have added a specification for a SPI EEPROM.  Chips like these
sell for as low as $0.13, from DigiKey, in large quantities.  This
particular part is about $1.00 in Quantity 1, and has 64 KB storage
and a SPI interface.

Note that the package is an SO8, which has 50 mil pin spacing
(50 thousandths of an inch), small, but can be soldered by
someone with good eyes and steady hands.

You can buy an adaptor:

You can buy a Universal Programmer ($50) from Amazon that seems to come with an SO8 adapter:

To avoid soldering altogether, you can buy a ZIF socket:
